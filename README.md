# shortened-reads
A React-based application that displays both short and long versions of news articles. It aims to make reading of news articles more convenient, simplifying the aricle for those who do not have the time to read it all, and maintains the longer form for those that do.

Home page of the website contains all the top headlines:

One can search for a specific topic using the search bar, and receive the relevant articles. The search button contains a bit of animation:

Upon selecting an article, the content is loaded in a user friendly manner:

The user can then view the article in the long form initially:

In case the user wishes to read the shortened version, then they can click on the "simplify" button. This generates a summarized version of the news article, and it happens in a user friendly manner:

Once the article is simplified, the user has the option to switch back and forth between the shorter version and the longer version of the article:
